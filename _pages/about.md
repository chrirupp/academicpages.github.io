I am Christian Rupprecht, postdoctoal researcher at [VGG](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) with [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in Oxford. I was a [PhD student](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/ChristianRupprecht) at the Technical University of Munich, Germany supervised by [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab) and [Gregory D. Hager](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~hager/). I have been an intern with [Chris Pal](http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/christopher.pal/) at the [Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/en/).
